_**Project Name: Psychological-Well-being-Chatbot

NLP Techniques Used:**_

Preprocessing: Implemented standard NLP preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to clean and prepare user input for analysis.

_**Chatbot Implementations:**_

_**Rule-based Chatbot:**_

Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Bag of Words models to match user queries with predefined responses.

_**Generative Chatbot:**_

Leveraged the _**Mistral X 7B**_  pre-trained model to generate responses based on deep learning techniques, providing more flexible and contextually relevant interactions.

_**Frontend:**_

Developed the user interface using Streamlit, enabling easy and interactive access to the chatbots for users seeking psychological well-being support.

This project successfully integrates both rule-based and generative approaches to create a comprehensive chatbot system for psychological well-being, with a user-friendly frontend developed in Streamlit.
